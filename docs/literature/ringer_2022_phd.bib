  abstract = {Livestreaming is the act of live broadcasting via the internet and allows viewer-host interaction via a text-based chat system. In particular, video game livestreaming is prevalent, where streamers host individual play sessions or present esports competitions. While livestreaming is an emerging entertainment medium, it is popular. For example, every minute, about 1900 hours of footage is livestreamed on Twitch.tv, currently the most popular video game livestreaming platform. It can be challenging for viewers to access the content they are most likely to enjoy. One solution is 'highlight videos', which can entertain users who did not watch a broadcast, e.g. due to a lack of awareness, availability, or willingness. Furthermore, livestream content creators can grow their audiences by using highlights to advertise their streams. We introduce and address the task of automatic livestream highlight detection: to automatically identify the best moments in livestream videos which can be extracted and edited into highlight videos.},
