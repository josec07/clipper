  abstract = {Most natural language processing research focuses on modelling and understanding text formed of complete sentences with correct spelling and grammar. However, livestream chat is drastically different. Viewers are typically writing short messages while responding to in-stream events, often with incorrect grammar and many repeated tokens. Additionally, tokens that are commonly used in livestream chat are unknown to traditional language understanding efforts that focus on prosaic text. To advance and encourage further research in terms of livestream chat understanding, in this work, we present a large-scale dataset of video game livestream chat, consisting of over 60 million tokens. We also provide preliminary models trained on this dataset, and demonstrate the utility of the dataset through an analysis of chat interactions on Twitch.},
