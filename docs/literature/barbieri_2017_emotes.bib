  abstract = {Videogame streaming platforms have become a paramount example of noisy user-generated text. These are websites where gaming is broadcasted, and allows interaction with viewers via integrated chatrooms. Probably the best known platform of this kind is Twitch, which has more than 100 million monthly viewers. Despite these numbers, and unlike other platforms featuring short messages (e.g. Twitter), Twitch has not received much attention from the NLP community. In this paper we present the first study focused on modeling Twitch emotes. We compile a dataset from a popular game and carry out a series of experiments to model the semantics of emotes in two different ways, showing that emotes are indeed semantically meaningful and useful to predict user behavior.},
